Theory.
=====================

Let's start with the basics. Humans have five senses, each of which receives stimulation from five different phenomena, resulting in five types of cognition. The eye receives stimulation from color, producing the cognition of brightness and color; the ear receives stimulation from sound, producing the cognition of sound; the nose receives stimulation from odor, producing the cognition of fragrance and stench; the tongue receives stimulation from taste, producing the cognition of sourness, sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, saltiness, and savoriness; and the body receives stimulation from touch, producing the cognition of softness, hardness, lightness, heaviness, roughness, smoothness, coldness, warmth, pain, and itchiness. In addition to these, the mind also produces memories and thoughts about past phenomena, which are referred to as "dharmas".

Therefore, humans have a total of six senses that produce six types of cognition. Here, we will name cognition as perception, which can be simplified as follows: the eye and color produce visual perception; the ear and sound produce auditory perception; the nose and fragrance produce olfactory perception; the tongue and taste produce gustatory perception; the body and touch produce tactile perception; and the mind and dharmas produce mental perception. The process of perception has six important characteristics: 

1. Each sense can only produce perception in response to its corresponding phenomenon and not others. For example, the eye can only produce visual perception in response to color and not sound, fragrance, taste, touch, or dharmas; similarly, the mind can only produce mental perception in response to dharmas and not color, sound, fragrance, taste, or touch. Each sense can only produce perception in response to its corresponding phenomenon.

2. Although we can have six types of perception, only one type can be produced at a time. It is like a tug-of-war game where the side with greater strength can pull the red cloth in the middle of the rope towards their side. The most attention-grabbing phenomenon can produce the corresponding perception. 

3. When perception arises, we may feel that "I am perceiving the phenomenon," "the mind or perception is perceiving the phenomenon," or "the sense organ is perceiving the phenomenon." However, perception is a new phenomenon produced by the stimulation of the sense organ by the phenomenon, and it is not something that is perceiving or cognizing anything. It is like how light is a new phenomenon produced when electricity passes through a light bulb, and it is not the light that illuminates the electricity, nor is it the light bulb or any other object that illuminates the electricity. Light is just a new phenomenon produced by the light bulb and electricity. 

4. When each sense and phenomenon produce perception, there will be accompanying sensations, thoughts, and mental formations. If we classify all material sense organs and phenomena as one category and name it color, then there are a total of five categories of phenomena in the process of perception: color, sensation, thought, mental formation, and perception. These five categories of phenomena encompass our entire body and mind. Traditionally, they are named the five aggregates: form, sensation, perception, mental formation, and consciousness. 

5. The five aggregates arise and immediately cease to exist. However, as long as we are alive and healthy, they will continue to arise and cease, old ones will pass away and new ones will arise, until death. At the moment of death, if ignorance and craving have not been eradicated by the last aggregate of consciousness ceasing to exist, then a new set of five aggregates will arise, which is a new life. This cycle of birth and death continues endlessly. 

6. It is like having a wound on our body that hurts when touched, when cold, when itchy, and when hot. We often suffer from various pains. Only when we scratch the itch with appropriate force, can we experience a momentary pleasure.

The five aggregates, accompanied by craving and attachment, are like a body with a wound that suffers more than it enjoys. When we encounter unpleasant phenomena, we suffer from the pain of resentment and hatred. When we cannot obtain the desired happiness, we suffer from the pain of seeking but not obtaining. When what we have obtained is lost or changed, we suffer from the pain of love and separation. If we see the five aggregates as "I," then we suffer from the pain of birth, aging, and death when they arise, persist, and cease. All of these are often accompanied by sorrow, grief, pain, worry, and annoyance. Only when craving and attachment are satisfied can we experience temporary happiness. 

It is important to note that many people believe that craving and attachment lead to suffering because they cause the five aggregates to be reborn, and it is this rebirth that causes suffering. Therefore, they believe that the five aggregates are suffering and aim to eliminate them to end suffering. However, craving and attachment are the direct cause of present suffering, not future suffering. Where there is love, there is suffering; where there is no love, there is no suffering. If the five aggregates arising in the present are accompanied by some form of craving or attachment and the object of that craving is unsatisfactory, then the five aggregates accompanied by craving will appear in the form of suffering in the present. If there is no such craving in the new five aggregates that arise in the next moment, then there will be no suffering.

For example, if someone loves someone of the opposite sex and becomes upset when they see them with someone else, but later falls out of love and no longer cares about their actions, they will no longer be upset. Therefore, when there is love, there may be suffering, and when there is no love, there may be no suffering.

If we do not understand this, we may mistakenly believe that eliminating the five aggregates is the way to end suffering. In fact, we do not need to eliminate any of the five aggregates or even any craving and attachment. The five aggregates arise and cease on their own, and even if we want to keep them, we cannot. This is also true for craving and attachment within the five aggregates. Therefore, there is no need to do anything extra to eliminate them. If we understand this principle, we will understand that ending suffering means preventing craving and attachment from arising in the rebirth of the five aggregates. The five aggregates have arisen and ceased in the past, and so have craving and attachment, as well as suffering. However, if the new five aggregates arising in our remaining life are without craving and attachment, then our remaining life will not experience sorrow, grief, pain, worry, or annoyance due to birth, aging, illness, death, resentment and hatred, love and separation, or seeking but not obtaining. This is called "Nirvana with remainder." 

Once the five aggregates of this life are completely extinguished, ignorance and craving are eliminated, then the five aggregates will be like a flame that has consumed all its fuel and extinguished itself. They will no longer cause new five aggregates to arise and completely cut off the root of suffering. This is called "Nirvana without remainder."

Some may wonder if the complete extinction of the five aggregates means that everything disappears into nothingness. What is the meaning of this? In fact, no matter whether we eliminate craving and attachment or not, we cannot prevent the five aggregates from arising and ceasing. Even a momentary pause is impossible. This is true in the present and also at death.

It is like a flame that arises and ceases, but because of the constant supply of fuel, the flame continues to arise. If we ignore the fact that the flame is constantly disappearing, we may mistakenly believe that the flame remains the same until it dissipates and extinguishes when the fuel is exhausted. If we do not understand that the five aggregates arise and completely cease, and then new five aggregates arise, we may mistakenly believe that the previous and subsequent five aggregates are the same, that they are the same from birth to death, and even believe that they are the same after death.

We may also see the five aggregates as "I" and fear their extinction. However, in fact, they are not the same, nor are they "I," and there is no "I" within or outside the five aggregates. Therefore, rebirth is just new five aggregates arising, and no rebirth is just not giving rise to new five aggregates.

Some may wonder, if there is no "I," then who experiences suffering? Who experiences liberation and Nirvana? This doubt arises because people do not fully understand that the five aggregates arise and completely cease. Although the previous five aggregates can lead to the subsequent five aggregates, they are completely independent phenomena. Because people mistakenly believe that there is something constant that runs through the previous and subsequent five aggregates, from birth to death, from this world to another world, or that something constant moves from one five aggregate to another, they believe that this thing is experiencing suffering or not experiencing suffering.

However, in fact, there is no such constant thing. When the five aggregates arise, they are just the five aggregates arising. When they cease, all of them disappear. If there is craving and attachment in the arising five aggregates, and the object of that craving is unsatisfactory, then craving will transform into suffering. In this case, the five aggregates are suffering. Similarly, when suffering arises, it is just suffering arising. When this suffering ceases, all of it disappears. In this process, there is no one who is enduring suffering or enduring the absence of suffering; there is only suffering arising and ceasing. If there is craving and attachment, suffering will continue to arise and cease. If craving and attachment continue to be reborn, suffering will continue endlessly. Without craving and attachment, after the old suffering ceases, no new suffering arises, which is liberation and Nirvana.

Practice.
=====================

Is there a method that can allow us to reduce or even eliminate craving, remove doubts, and completely sever the cycle of suffering in this life, in the present moment, starting from this very moment? Yes, the method of practice can be divided into two steps: first, distancing oneself and being alone. The places where modern people live are often filled with various comfortable and tempting sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches, which are called the five desires. It is difficult for an untamed mind to resist the temptation of the five desires, and therefore, various cravings arise when encountering them. In order to avoid these temptations and reduce the production of craving, we should try to stay away from busy and noisy places. We should go to quiet and undisturbed wilderness or empty houses, restrain our senses, regulate our diet, behave properly, reduce our affairs, and live a simple life. If conditions do not permit this, we can arrange a quiet and simple room at home or nearby for solitude and enter this room to restrain ourselves as mentioned earlier. Second, practice the four foundations of mindfulness. Suppose six different animals - dog, bird, snake, wolf, fish, and monkey - were caught together and tied to the same pole in a square. The dog wants to enter the village, the bird wants to fly into the sky, the snake wants to crawl into a hole, the wolf wants to go to the wilderness, the fish wants to jump into the water, and the monkey wants to enter the forest. They all have their own desired destinations. But because they are tied up and constantly struggling, they eventually become exhausted and can only rely on the pole for support. The six restrained senses are like these six animals, constantly wanting to cling to their favorite phenomena. In order to tame these senses, we also need to tie them to a pole, which is mindfulness of the body.

Mindfulness of the body means: wholeheartedly focusing inward on one's body as a whole or in parts, being enthusiastic, focused, discerning, and thoughtful. Just like when driving, if we focus wholeheartedly on the road ahead, are enthusiastic about driving, focused, discerning, and thoughtful, we will know if there is a car ahead, if the car has stopped, is moving or if there are pedestrians or obstacles. Whatever the road conditions are, we will know them immediately. Similarly, if we focus wholeheartedly on our body as a whole, being enthusiastic, focused, discerning, and thoughtful, we will know if we are sitting, standing, walking or lying down. Whatever our body is doing at that moment - moving forward or backward, raising our hands or feet, getting dressed or eating - we will know it immediately. When walking, if we focus wholeheartedly on our feet, being enthusiastic, focused, discerning, and thoughtful, we will know if we are lifting our feet or putting them down, if our left foot or right foot is stepping forward. When sitting, if we focus wholeheartedly on our breath, being enthusiastic, focused, discerning, and thoughtful, we will know if we are exhaling or inhaling. Just like planting flowers and trees, all we need to do is water and fertilize them at the right time, and the flowers will bloom and the trees will grow naturally. Mindfulness of the body is the same - as long as we focus wholeheartedly on our body as a whole or in parts, being enthusiastic, focused, discerning, and thoughtful, whatever we focus on will be known naturally and immediately. If we can continue to focus inwardly on our body, we will remain aware of the state of our body and will not be affected by external factors, avoiding the arising of greed, love, sorrow, and worry. Even when seeing other elderly people, sick people, dead bodies, rotten, incomplete, or dry bones, we should also turn our attention to ourselves and think that our body will also become old, sick, die, rot, be incomplete, and turn into dry bones. This will reduce our attachment to the body. It is extremely important to note that the mindfulness of the body mentioned here is very different from what is taught today.

The first difference: In other teachings of mindfulness of the body, many people believe that when hearing sounds, they can mark or observe what they hear, and when seeing things, they can mark or observe what they see, and when smelling, tasting, touching, etc., they can also mark or observe. However, here we must concentrate our attention on the body and pay attention to every movement of the body. If we are attracted by other senses or realms, we must immediately shift our attention back to the body. Do not forget the analogy of the six animals, the body is the pillar we rely on. The purpose of concentrating our attention on the body is to prevent our attention from turning elsewhere. In order to prevent our attention from unconsciously shifting, we also need to frequently check, reflect and remind ourselves to focus on the body.

The second difference: In other teachings of mindfulness of the body, people are often taught to carefully observe the phenomena produced by the body, explore their essence and causes. For example, when lifting the foot, we need to observe the process of lifting the foot carefully and deeply, in order to study the essence of lifting the foot, discover the motivation for lifting the foot, and see the truth of lifting the foot. However, here we just need to focus our attention on the body and make sure that we know its real-time state accurately. For example, when focusing on the feet, lifting the foot is just a phenomenon that we naturally know when we focus on this area. What we need to ensure is uninterrupted and accurate knowledge of the real-time state of the feet, rather than exploring its essence and causes. Just like when driving, we do not focus on the essence or causes of cars, pedestrians, or traffic lights on the road ahead. The reason why we can see them is because we concentrate our attention on the road ahead. The reason why we need to be wholeheartedly focused, enthusiastic, focused, discerning, is to ensure that our attention always faces the road ahead, and we know the real-time road conditions continuously and accurately. Similarly, we do not focus on the essence or causes of standing, walking, sitting, lying down, raising hands or feet, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching when focusing on the body. The reason why we can know these phenomena is because we concentrate our attention on the body. The reason why we need to be wholeheartedly focused, enthusiastic, focused, discerning, is to ensure that our attention always faces the body, and we know the real-time state of the body continuously and accurately.

The third difference: This is the most important and difficult difference to distinguish from other teachings of mindfulness of the body. The body produces various sensations due to touch, such as hardness, softness, coldness, warmth, pain, itching, etc. In other teachings of mindfulness of the body, when there is a sensation in the body, one can focus on the sensation, observe it carefully or explore its essence deeply. For example, when there is pain, one can delve into the pain, observe it until the pain disappears. This method is widely used in various meditation practices popular in the world today. However, the focus of mindfulness of the body here is always on the body itself, and it is important to remind oneself not to forget the analogy of the six animals. It should be noted that touch is a bodily consciousness that arises because attention is biased towards "touch", just as hearing consciousness arises because attention is biased towards sound. Focusing on touch is no different from focusing on scenery or music. People immerse themselves in observing these bodily sensations precisely because they mistake them for "feeling" in the context of mindfulness of feelings, thinking that observing these sensations is practicing mindfulness of feelings. But in fact, they are external phenomena, they are "touch", just like "color, sound, smell, and taste" are external phenomena, they are the "touch" in the five desires "color, sound, smell, taste, and touch". When people delve deep into these bodily sensations, they are deviating from the internal body and being attracted by the five desires. Therefore, if various sensations such as coldness, warmth, pain, itching, lightness, and heaviness occur, we should not only delve into these sensations but also remind ourselves to redirect our attention back to the body. This difference is difficult for beginners to distinguish, and only by practicing mindfulness of the body correctly can one skillfully redirect attention inward to the internal body. However, this difference is crucial. If people mistake these bodily sensations for "feeling" in mindfulness of feelings, true mindfulness of feelings cannot be developed.

So, what is the feeling referred to in mindfulness of feelings? Just as hitting a drum with different objects such as a stick, stone, bottle, or fist produces loud, soft, or moderate sounds, when various touches such as coldness, warmth, pain, itching, hardness, and softness are felt by the body, only three types of feeling arise within the body: painful feeling, pleasant feeling, and neutral feeling. If we only focus on the internal body and not other phenomena, we can gradually become aware of these three internal feelings. Furthermore, when colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and mental objects stimulate the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and mind, we can skillfully grasp the feelings that arise within us. When we can skillfully grasp the internal feelings, we can concentrate fully on them with enthusiasm and focus, and discern them clearly. When painful feelings arise, we will know the painful feeling as it is; when pleasant feelings arise, we will know the pleasant feeling as it is; when neutral feelings arise, we will know the neutral feeling as it is. No matter what kind of feeling arises within us at that moment, we will know it as it is in the first place. This is practicing mindfulness of feelings. If we can continue to focus inward on our feelings, we will always be aware of what internal feeling is arising and will not be affected by other phenomena in the world. Therefore, we can avoid the arising of corresponding desires and sorrows. After fully understanding the feelings, we can grasp our own minds. Similarly, if people do not understand their feelings well, they cannot grasp their minds correctly. When we can skillfully grasp our minds, we can concentrate fully on our minds with enthusiasm and focus and discern them clearly. When anger arises, we will know there is anger within us; when anger disappears, we will know there is no anger within us; when greed arises, we will know there is greed within us; when greed disappears, we will know there is no greed within us. No matter what state our mind is in at that moment, whether it is confused, concentrated, pure, or liberated, we will know it as it is in the first place. This is practicing mindfulness of the mind. If we can continue to focus inward on our minds, we will always be aware of what internal feeling is arising and will not be affected by other phenomena in the world. Therefore, we can avoid the arising of corresponding desires and sorrows. After clearly understanding our minds, we can gradually grasp the mental objects within them, just as when we hear a sound coming from a certain place, we can find the source of the sound by following it. For example, when we skillfully understand anger, we can gradually understand anger itself; when we skillfully understand greed, we can gradually understand greed itself. Greed and anger are mental objects in this context. If we concentrate fully on mental objects with enthusiasm and focus and discern them clearly, when anger arises, we will know there is anger within us; when there is no anger, we will know there is no anger within us; if there was no anger before but now it arises, we will know it as it is; when anger that has already arisen disappears and does not arise again, we will know it as it is. The same applies to greed, dullness, restlessness, and doubt.

When colors and phenomena arise and cease, we will know them as they are: this is color, this is the arising of color, this is the ceasing of color; when sensations arise and cease, we will know them as they are: this is sensation, this is the arising of sensation, this is the ceasing of sensation; when thoughts arise and cease, we will know them as they are: this is thought, this is the arising of thought, this is the ceasing of thought; when actions arise and cease, we will know them as they are: this is action, this is the arising of action, this is the ceasing of action; when consciousness arises and ceases, we will know them as they are: this is consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness, this is the ceasing of consciousness. No matter what phenomena arise within us at that moment, whether it is related to the six senses, dependent origination, the seven factors of enlightenment, the Noble Eightfold Path, or the Four Noble Truths, we will know them as they are in the first place. This is practicing mindfulness of phenomena. If we can continue to focus inward on phenomena, we will always be aware of what internal phenomena are arising and will not be affected by other phenomena in the world. Therefore, we can avoid the arising of corresponding desires and sorrows. During this process, we start with mindfulness of the body and gradually progress to mindfulness of sensations, mindfulness of mind, and mindfulness of phenomena. When mindfulness of phenomena is perfected, mindfulness of the four foundations of mindfulness is perfected; when mindfulness of the four foundations of mindfulness is perfected, mindfulness of the factors of enlightenment is perfected; when mindfulness of the factors of enlightenment is perfected, wisdom arises; when wisdom arises, diligence arises; when diligence arises, joy arises; when joy arises, tranquility arises; when tranquility arises, concentration arises; when concentration arises, detachment arises; when detachment arises, we let go of all excess, exhaust love, have no desires, extinguish defilements, and attain nirvana. If people do not practice mindfulness of the body correctly, they cannot reach the true mindfulness of sensations, let alone mindfulness of mind and mindfulness of phenomena. If mindfulness of phenomena is not practiced correctly, we cannot truly know what are the five hindrances, five aggregates, six senses, and dependent origination. If we do not truly know phenomena, we cannot perfect the seven factors of enlightenment, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Four Noble Truths. However, as long as we can master mindfulness of the body correctly, we can lead one phenomenon to another, perfect one phenomenon and then move on to the next, and progress step by step until liberation and nirvana. Therefore, I hope that from this moment on, everyone can leave behind the tempting environment and focus wholeheartedly on the internal body. Just as we value our own lives, we should value mindfulness of the body, use the body as a pillar, stand on the internal body, and embark on the path of practice.
